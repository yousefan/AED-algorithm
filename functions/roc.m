%
% ROC - generate a receiver operating characteristic curve
%
%    [TP,FP] = ROC(T,Y) gives the true-positive rate (TP) and false positive
%    rate (FP), where Y is a column vector giving the score assigned to each
%    pattern and T indicates the true class (a value above zero represents
%    the positive class and anything else represents the negative class).  To
%    plot the ROC curve,
%
%       PLOT(FP,TP);
%       XLABEL('FALSE POSITIVE RATE');
%       YLABEL('TRUE POSITIVE RATE');
